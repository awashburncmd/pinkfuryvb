        About us
    </h1>
    <p>Pink Fury Volleyball was founded by Hannah Kirkendoll and Ava Kramer with a shared passion for helping others discover and enjoy volleyball. 
        <br>With over a year of coaching experience at the YMCA, working with kids aged 8-10, weâ€™ve seen firsthand how dedication and skill-building can set young athletes up for success. <br>Many players from those early teams went on to join club volleyball, excelling in the sport.

        In addition to our experience at the YMCA, we currently coach the 13U Diamond team<br>at Midwest Shock Volleyball Club. Our goal is to inspire players to develop confidence, improve their skills, and foster a lifelong love of the game.</p>
